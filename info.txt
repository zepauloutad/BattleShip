Battleship.
This game is still a demo under development within the scope of the subject LAB 2nd Semester 2020/2021.
How does it work?.
When the game starts,the program will choose who will be the first to play, the player or the bot.
Then the player needs to place all of his boats on his board,in this demo you can use up to 4 boats.
When all the boats from the player and the bot are place down, you can start your move.
Each player has 3 shoots per turn from a total of 100 shots, you need to guess the positions of the enemy boats in their board.
The one who first destroys all of the enemy boats wins.

Important info:

O = a boat.
A = a missed shot.
T = a destroyed boat.

Rules:
                                                                                        
You can t place down a boat on the same location or in the cells around it.
